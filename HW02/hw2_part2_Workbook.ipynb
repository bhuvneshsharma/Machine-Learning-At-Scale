As you develop your implementation you'll test it on a small dataset that matches the 'Chinese Example' in the _Manning, Raghavan and Shutze_ reading for Week 2. For the main task in part 2 you'll be working with a small subset of the Enron Spam/Ham Corpus. By the end of this portion of the assignment you should be able to:\n",

The subset we will use is limited to emails from 6 Enron employees and a number of spam sources. It is part of [this data set](http://www.aueb.gr/users/ion/data/enron-spam/) which was created by researchers working on personlized Bayesian spam filters.

    "* __a) short response:__ Equation 13.3 in Manning, Raghavan and Shutze shows how a Multinomial Naive Bayes model classifies a document. It predicts the class, $c$, for which the estimated conditional probability of the class given the document's contents,  $\\hat{P}(c|d)$, is greatest. In this equation what two pieces of information are required to calculate  $\\hat{P}(c|d)$? Your answer should include both mathematical notatation and verbal explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) short response:__ The Enron data includes two classes of documents: `spam` and `ham` (they're actually labeled `1` and `0`). In plain English, explain what  $\\hat{P}(c)$ and   $\\hat{P}(t_{k} | c)$ mean in the context of this data. How will we would estimate these values from a training corpus? How many passes over the data would we need to make to retrieve this information for all classes and all words?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "In the next two questions you'll write code to parallelize the Naive Bayes calculations that you performed above. We'll do this in two phases: one MapReduce job to perform training and a second MapReduce to perform inference. While in practice we'd need to train a model before we can use it to classify documents, for learning purposes we're going to develop our code in the opposite order. By first focusing on the pieces of information/format we need to perform the classification (inference) task you should find it easier to develop a solid implementation for training phase when you get to question 9 below. In both of these questions we'll continue to use the Chinese example corpus from the textbook to help us test our MapReduce code as we develop it. Below we've reproduced the corpus, test set and model in text format that matches the Enron data.\n",

This text file represents a Naive Bayes model trained (with Laplace +1 smoothing) on the example corpus. What are the 'keys' and 'values' in this file? Which record means something slightly different than the rest? The value field of each record includes two numbers which will be helpful for debugging but which we don't actually need to perform inference -- what are they? [`HINT`: _This file represents the model from Example 13.1 in the textbook, if you're having trouble getting oriented try comparing our file to the numbers in that example._]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) short response:__ When performing Naive Bayes in practice instead of multiplying the probabilities (as in equation 13.3) we add their logs (as in equation 13.4). Why do we choose to work with log probabilities? If we had an unsmoothed model, what potential error could arise from this transformation?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) short response:__ Documents 6 and 8 in the test set include a word that did not appear in the training corpus (and as a result does not appear in the model). What should we do at inference time when we need a class conditional probability for this word?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ The goal of our MapReduce job is to stream over the test set and classify each document by peforming the calculation from equation 13.4. To do this we'll load the model file (which contains the probabilities for equation 13.4) into memory on the nodes where we do our mapping. This is called an in-memory join, we'll learn more about those in Week 5. For now, explain how this is a slight departure from one of the functional programming principles. From a scalability perspective when might this departure be justified? when would it be unwise?\n",

[`HINT 1:` _you shouldn't need a reducer for this one._ `HINT 2:` _Don't forget to add the model file to the_ `-files` _parameter in your Hadoop streaming job so that it gets shipped to the mapper nodes where it will be accessed by your script._]\n",

    "* __f) short response:__ In our test example and in the Enron data set we have fairly short documents. Since these fit fine in memory on a mapper node we didn't need a reducer and could just do all of our calculations in the mapper. However with much longer documents (eg. books) we might want a higher level of parallelization -- for example we might want to process parts of a document on different nodes. In this hypothetical scenario how would our algorithm design change? What could the mappers still do? What key-value structure would they emit? What would the reducers have to do as a last step?"

The end result of the MapReduce job you write in this question should be a model text file that looks just like the example (`NBmodel.txt`) that we created by hand above.\n",
    "\n",
    "To refresh your memory about the training process take a look at  `7a` and `7b` where you described the pieces of information you'll need to collect in order to encode a Multinomial Naive Bayes model. We now want to retrieve those pieces of information while streaming over a corpus. The bulk of the task will be very similar to the word counting excercises you've already done but you may want to consider a slightly different key-value record structure to efficiently tally counts for each class. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most challenging (interesting?) design question will be how to retrieve the totals (# of documents and # of words in documents for each class). Of course, counting these numbers is easy. The hard part is the timing: you'll need to make sure you have the counts totalled up _before_ you start estimating the class conditional probabilities for each word. It would be best (i.e. most scalable) if we could find a way to do this tallying without storing the whole vocabulary in memory... _can you see why this is gong to be a challenge?_ [`HINT:` _There is a problem with trying to tally in the mapper but also a problem with waiting to do it in the reducer. _]. __For part `b` of this question you will receive full credit for any design that results in the correct conditional probabilities _without hard coding the class totals_ (i.e. you _can_ store records in memory if you so choose).__ However, for fun, we challenge you to try and figure out the stateless solution. It involves a technique that you will learn formally next week but we think you may be able to figure it out for yourself. [`HINT:` _Think about Hadoop's default sorting behavior, what determines the order in which records arrive at the reducer?  If we compute partial totals in our mappers can you think of a way to make sure that those numbers arrive at our reducer before any of the other 'regular' key-value pairs?_`]\n",

    "### Q9 Tasks:\n",
    "* __a) make a plan:__  Fill in the docstrings for __`NaiveBayes/train_mapper.py`__ and __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer.py`__ to appropriately reflect the format that each script will input/output. [`HINT:` _the input files_ (`enronemail_1h.txt` & `chineseTrain.txt`) _have a prespecified format and your output file should match_ `NBmodel.txt` _so you really only have to decide on an internal format for Hadoop_].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) implement it:__ Complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/train_mapper.py`__ and __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer.py`__ so that together they train a Multinomial Naive Bayes model __with no smoothing__. Make sure your end result is formatted correctly (see note above). Test your scripts independently and together (using `chineseTrain.txt` or test input of your own devising). When you are satisfied with your Python code design and run a Hadoop streaming command to run your job in parallel on the __chineseTrain.txt__. Confirm that your trained model matches your hand calculations from Question 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) short response:__ We saw in Question 7 that adding Laplace +1 smoothing makes our classifications less sensitve to rare words. However implementing this technique requires access to one additional piece of information that we had not previously used in our Naive Bayes training. What is that extra piece of information? [`HINT:` see equation 13.7 in Manning, Raghavan and Schutze].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ There are three approaches that we could take to handle the extra piece of information you identified in `c`: 1) we could hard code it into our reducer (_where would we get it in the first place?_). Or 2) we could compute it inside the reducer which would require storing some information in memory (_what information?_). Or 3) we could compute it in the reducer without storing any bulky information in memory but then we'd need some postprocessing or a second MapReduce job to complete the calculation (_why?_). Breifly explain what is non-ideal about each of these options. BONUS: which of these options is incompatible with using multiple reducers?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) code + short response:__ In future weeks we'll learn better ways to handle this kind of situation. For now, chose one of the 3 options above. State your choice & reasoning in the space below then use that strategy to complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer_smooth.py`__. Test this alternate reducer then write and run a Hadoop streaming job to train an MNB model with smoothing on the Chinese example. Your results should match the model that we provided for you in Question 9 (and the calculations in the textbook example). [`HINT:` _don't start from scratch with this one -- you can just copy over your reducer code from part `b` and make the needed modifications_]."

    "> __ c)__ Size of the vocabulary i.e. number of distinct words.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __ d)__ Option 1 is not ideal because it makes our reducer less generalizable since the numbers are hard-coded. Option 2 may not work if required memory on the reducer is large (at least, it won't be so scalable). The memory problem is exacerbated since we have to keep everything in memory. I also cannot see how this method will allow multiple reducers since we will need to count total vocab and this has to be done globally. Option 3 requires us to run another mapping job, or to post-process the data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> __ e)__ I choose to implement it via variant of Option 1 where the mapper counts the vocab and emits it (the string of distinct words) and is read by the reducer. This method does not rely on full memory join on the reducer (memory is confined to mapper nodes), does not require post-processing, and can still be run on two reducers (max).\n"

    "# Question 10: Enron Ham/Spam NB Classifier & Results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fantastic work. We're finally ready to perform Spam Classification on the Enron Corpus. In this final homework question you'll run the analysis you've developed, report its performance, and draw some conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q10 Tasks:\n",
    "* __a) train/test split:__ Run the provided code to split our Enron file into a training set and testing set then load them into HDFS. [`NOTE:` _If you hard coded the vocab size in question 9d make sure you re calculate the vocab size for just the training set!_]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) train 2 models:__ Write Hadoop Streaming jobs to train MNB Models on the training set with and without smoothing. Save your models to local files at __`NaiveBayes/Unsmoothed/NBmodel.txt`__ and __`NaiveBayes/Smoothed/NBmodel.txt`__. [`NOTE:` _This naming is important because we wrote our classification task so that it expects a file of that name... if this inelegance frustrates you there is an alternative that would involve a few adjustments to your code [read more about it here](http://www.tnoda.com/blog/2013-11-23). If you can let it slide for now, MRJob (the next framework we'll learn) will have an easier way to handle this._] Finally run the checks that we provide to confirm that your results are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) code:__ Recall that we designed our classification job with just a mapper. An efficient way to report the performance of our models would be to simply add a reducer phase to this job and compute precision and recall right there. Complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/evaluation_reducer.py`__ and then write Hadoop jobs to evaluate your two models on the test set. Report their performance side by side. [`NOTE:` if you need a refresher on precision, recall and F1-score [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score) is a good resource.]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ Compare the performance of your two models. What do you notice about the unsmoothed model's predictions? Can you guess why this is happening? Which evaluation measure do you think is most relevant in our use case? [`NOTE:` _Feel free to answer using your common sense but if you want more information on evaluating the classification task checkout_ [this blogpost](https://tryolabs.com/blog/2013/03/25/why-accuracy-alone-bad-measure-classification-tasks-and-what-we-can-do-about-it/\n",
    ") or [this paper](http://www.flinders.edu.au/science_engineering/fms/School-CSEM/publications/tech_reps-research_artfcts/TRRA_2007.pdf\n",
    ")]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) code + short response:__ Let's look at the top ten words with the highest conditional probability in `Spam` and in `Ham`. We'll do this by writing a Hadoop job that sorts the model file (`NaiveBayes/Smoothed/NBmodel.py`). Normally we'd have to run two jobs -- one that sorts on $P(word|ham)$ and another that sorts on $P(word|spam)$. However if we slighly modify the data format in the model file then we can get the top words in each class with just one job. We've written a mapper that will do just this for you. Read through __`NaiveBayes/model_sort_mapper.py`__ and then briefly explain how this mapper will allow us to partition and sort our model file. Write a Hadoop job that uses our mapper and `/bin/cat` for a reducer to partition and sort. Print out the top 10 words in each class (where 'top' == highest conditional probability).[`HINT:` _this should remind you a lot of what we did in Question 6._]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __f) short response:__ What do you notice about the 'top words' we printed in `e`? How would increasing the smoothing parameter 'k' affect the probabilities for the top words that you identified for 'e'. How would they affect the probabilities of words that occur much more in one class than another? In summary, how does the smoothing parameter 'k' affect the bias and the variance of our model. [`NOTE:` _you do not need to code anything for this task, but if you are struggling with it you could try changing 'k' and see what happens to the test set. We don't recommend doing this exploration with the Enron data because it will be harder to see the impact with such a big vocabulary_]"

    "### Q10 Student Answers:\n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ On all metrics, the smoothed model does better. This is probably because smoothing allows us to assign some probability to words we saw for spam or ham but are not present respective class in the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __e)__ The mapper splits the sample into spam and ham, the we use the partition option as in the last part of Q6 to sort by maximum conditional probability over the population of spam and ham. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __f)__ The higher the k, the higher the bias (and lower the variance). Many of the words in both classes seem to be common in English (note: one thing to do might be to exclude these words), and if we increase smoothing one would except their conditional probabilities to drop as greater probability mass is transfered to less common words.

    "Congratulations you've completed all the required questions! If you have energy for more, let's take a moment to preview one of the important design issues that we'll tackle next week: total order sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the jobs in this assignment we've mostly used a single reducer and mostly used the default Hadoop sorting (alphabetical by key). However when we took the time to specify an alternate key to sort on and tried using multiple reducers (as we did in Questions 5d, 6e and 10d)... we saw that sorting and partitioning the data on different fields can cause our final output to no longer be sorted from top to bottom. Instead it will usually be sorted just within each partition. This is called a partial sort and in the examples we saw that was mostly what we wanted.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've also always partitioned on a categorical field. But what if we wanted to sort on values (eg. counts in a word count file) but have too much data to fit on a single reducer and there isn't a logical categorical variable to use as a partition key? How could we ensure the the top-n words end up in `part-00000`, the next n end up in `part-00001`, etc? The solution is similar in idea to what we did in Question 10b (where we created extra fields to partition on)... but a bit more complicated because the way that Hadoop orders its partitions and writes them to file depends on an internal hash function (eg. we might expect the partition with key `ham` to end up in `part-00000` and `spam` to end up in `part-00001` but Hadoop won't necessarily order the words the way a human reader would).\n",
    "\n",
    "__Challenge Exercise:__ Write a Hadoop job that will use 5 reducers and will sort your `NBmodel.txt` file (you can use the smoothed or unsmoothed one) in descending order according to the words' conditional probability in `spam`. A few tips:\n",
    "* start by reading the [Total Sort Notebook](https://github.com/UCB-w261/main/blob/master/Resources/TotalSortGuide/_total-sort-guide-spark2.01-JAN27-2017.ipynb) that is provided in the course repo under the HelpfulResources folder.\n",
    "* you will need to write a mapper for this job, you can do this easily on the fly using the jupyter magic command `%%writefile`.\n",
    "* when you run your job, you should see that the records in `part-00000` have higher conditional probabilities in Spam, than the records in `part-00001` which in turn are higher than in `part-00002` etc."
